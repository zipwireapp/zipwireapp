# Copyright Infringement Claims

## Notification of Copyright Infringement Claims

Making original work is hard! As described in our [Use Restrictions policy](../abuse/index.md), you can’t use Zipwire to make or disseminate work that uses the intellectual property of others beyond the bounds of fair use.

## Copyright and UK Law

The United Kingdom has long had laws that protect original work and intellectual property, and more recent legislation that applies to the Internet era.

#### Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988

This act provides the legal framework for protecting copyright works in the UK. It outlines the rights that creators have to control the use of their works and to seek redress when their rights are infringed.

#### Digital Economy Act 2017

The act addresses policy issues related to electronic communications infrastructure and services, and updates the conditions for and sentencing of criminal copyright infringement.

#### Copyright and Rights in Performances (Quotation and Parody) Regulations 2014

This legislation reforms UK copyright rules that enable private copying, parodying and general quotation of copyrighted material to take place legally.

Additionally, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is a useful resource at [wipo.int](https://wipo.int).

### Are you a copyright owner?

You have the right to notify us if you believe that an account user has infringed on your work(s) as copyright owner. To be effective, the notification of claimed infringement must be written. Please include the following information:

- A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
- Identification of the copyrighted work(s) claimed to have been infringed. If there are multiple, please share a representative list of those works.
- A way for us to locate the material you believe is infringing the copyrighted work.
- Your name and contact information so that we can get back to you. Email address is preferred but a telephone number or mailing address works too.
- A statement that you, in good faith, believe that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
- A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

## Objections

On the flip-side, if you believe your material has been removed in error, you can counter the action with a written objection. Please include the following information:

- A physical or electronic signature, or the signature of the person authorized to act on your behalf.
- A description of the material that was removed.
- A description of where the material appeared in Zipwire products prior to their removal.
- Your name and contact information so that we can get back to you. Email address is preferred but a telephone number or mailing address works too.
- A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification.
- A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, in the Northern District of Illinois (where Zipwire is located).
- A statement that you will accept service of process from the person who filed the original DMCA notice or an agent of that person. (In other words, you’ve designated that person to receive documents on your behalf.)
