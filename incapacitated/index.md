# Incapacitated account holder

## Overview

This policy outlines how we handle Zipwire accounts when the account holder becomes incapacitated or passes away. We understand this is a sensitive situation and we aim to handle it with care and respect.

## Process

1. When we receive a request regarding an incapacitated account holder, we will:
   * Verify the identity of the requester
   * Review any provided documentation
   * Consider the best interests of all parties involved

2. We may require documentation such as:
   * Power of attorney
   * Death certificate
   * Court orders
   * Other legal documentation

3. We will work with the appropriate parties to:
   * Preserve important data
   * Transfer account access if appropriate
   * Close the account if requested

## Contact us

If you need to report an incapacitated account holder, please email us at [support@zipwire.io](mailto:support@zipwire.io).

Managing administrative aspects is often the last thing you may want to do under these circumstances. We've tried to set up a process that makes managing this situation as smooth as possible while also honoring the privacy and security obligations we have to our customers.

People may be using Zipwire in the following ways.

- As a sender of timesheets.
- As an approver of timesheets.
- As a processor of timesheets.
- As an administrator of a workplace.

It's possible for a person to combine these capacities. For the first three, the workplace which manages the deceased's assignments should be notified and they can make any necessary changes.

These accounts and their data will be removed after 6 months of inactivity.

A sender may work as a freelancer or via a company entity in which case they may have unsubmitted time tracked and have unpaid work outstanding. In those situations we can help you access the time that was tracked, or who they were working for, but this would more often be a matter for their agency and/or client to settle without the need to access their Zipwire data.

When a workplace has no other administrators configured, other people within the organisation will be unable to make changes so we will need to promote another Zipwire account to become an administrator and regain access.

Note that paid subscriptions are associated with a workplace, which has one or more administrator accounts.

In some cases the entire workplace comprises just a single person.

**If you just want to stop the account from being billed and do not need access to any data,** the fastest way to do this is by cancelling the associated credit card directly via the credit card company.

**If you have the login credentials of the account,** you can manage billing, download reports, and cancel a subscription via the billing portal. Our support team can assist you.

**If you do not have login credentials but do have legal authority to manage someone's affairs,** we will try to help. However, please know in advance that we cannot provide login credentials since we do not store them.

## For Workplace Administrators

If the account was a workplace administrator and you are a colleague, proprieter or other appointed legal administrator for the organisation and you need to take over administratrative access.

The following process may take several days to weeks as we go through verification steps. To get started, please email [support@zipwire.io](mailto:support@zipwire.io) with:

* Legal documents proving your appointment to a director level role within the workplace organisation within its country of incorporation, for example the AP01 form for Companies House in the United Kingdom.
* The documents must be sent from the same director from their company email address.
* The name of the workplace.
* The email address of the current administrator account as used for Zipwire correspondence.
* An email from the company email address of the current administrator account. We use this to prove you have authority of control over the person's mailboxes within their workplace.

If we are able to successfully verify the information you have shared, we'll email the account in question with a notification and option to dispute the request.

After a reasonable waiting period to allow for any dispute response, we'll be able to help with the following:

* Cancelling the account, which will lead to deleting the account data. Please refer to our [Cancellation policy](../cancellation/index.md) for more information.
* Providing an export of the account contents.

We delete all information shared with us for verification purposes immediately after we finish the verification process.

## For All Other Accounts

The verification process may take some time as we carefully review all documentation. To get started, please email [support@zipwire.io](mailto:support@zipwire.io) with:

* Legal documents proving your designated role in managing this person's affairs. Acceptable documents include: a copy of a fully-executed Power of Attorney; or a copy of an official Death Certificate *and* one of the following: a) a copy of a will or trust document naming you as executor or beneficiary; b) a marriage certificate if you are a surviving spouse; c) a birth certificate if you are their parent or proof of guardianship for legal guardians.
* The Zipwire email address of your loved one.
* A few pieces of information to help with the verification process:

  - If the name on the legal documents do not match the name we have on record for the account owner, we'll need some sort of proof that the document is for the same individual.
  - A photograph showing the following things in the same picture: 1. a photo selfie showing your face; 2. a picture of your Government Issued ID (Passport, Drivers License, etc...) next to your face; 3. a piece of paper with "Verification for Zipwire" and today's date.
  - The region and postal code likely used for the person's billing address.
  - The last four numbers of the credit card likely used to pay for the person's account.

If we are able to successfully verify the information you have shared, we'll email the account in question with a notification and option to dispute the request.

After a reasonable waiting period to allow for any dispute response, we'll be able to help with the following:

* Cancelling the account, which will lead to deleting the account data. Please refer to our [Cancellation policy](../cancellation/index.md) for more information.
* Providing an export of the account contents.

We delete all information shared with us for verification purposes immediately after we finish the verification process.
