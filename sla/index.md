## Our commitment to keeping Zipwire available

While we give no specific gaurantees about the availability of Zipwire, our engineers are proud of their work and committed to making sure Zipwire is almost never offline. This is much easier to achieve than in decades past because we build Zipwire on cloud technologies that have their own gaurantees on uptime and redundancy. Rest assured, we make great choices when selecting and configuring the cloud infrastructure that underpins our software to ensure it is secure, highly-available and resistant to data loss in the event of an accident or disaster.

Data is stored in systems that are replicated in a manner that makes them resilient to catastrophe. We place our trust in Google Cloud and you place your trust in us. That said, no system is perfect and we cannot gaurantee the safety of data beyond unprecedented disaster across a wide geography. At present, your data is stored on physical structures, encrypted, within the United States of America, on Google's equipment. Please see our [privacy policy](https://zipwire.io/data/privacy) which discusses our treatment of your data.

## Will this change in the future?

Zipwire may update this SLA once in a blue moon â€” we'll notify you about significant changes by emailing the account owner or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
