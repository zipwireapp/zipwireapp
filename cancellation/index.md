# Cancellation policy

We want satisfied customers, not hostages. That’s why we make it easy for you to cancel your subscription. We use the very popular Stripe payments and subscriptions management platform for billing paid accounts. Stripe provides a subscription management web portal through which you can add payment methods, update your information or cancel your subscription.

Zipwire provides easy access to the Stripe billing management portal via our website.

At present, simple accounts who are not subscribers or administrators of workplace accounts, can delete their accounts and have all their data erased with a few clicks. If you have recently setup an account and a workplace for testing and evaluation of Zipwire, you can also delete your account, its associated workplace and all its data.

Please recognise that accounts can invite other users to Zipwire and that these users or their data will not be deleted, however invitations may be deleted if they have not been accepted. Some data spans the relationship between accounts, such as a workplace and its timesheet senders. Data held about this relationship is owned by the workplace and is deleted with the workplace. Some spanning data is held in duplicate to reflect its co-owned status, like a sender's full name.

Our legal responsibility is to account owners, which means we cannot cancel an account at the request of anyone else. If for whatever reason you no longer know who the account owner is, contact us using the data support link in the footer. We will gladly reach out to any current account owners at the email addresses we have on file.

## What happens when you cancel?

You will still be able to access your account and your workplace once you cancel. We bill you based on your consumption of the Services. For Zipwire, this means we measure your sender's usage of your assigned approval workflows. We count a single sender usage the first time they send a timesheet within a billing period.

Once you cancel your subscription, you will not be able to add more senders if you already have more senders assigned than our free allowance and your senders may not be able to send timesheets.

If you want to delete your account and the Delete button is not available on your profile, please contact support and we will manually erase your account and its data.

You may be billed for the Services consumed so far. We have designed Zipwire and its consumption based billing on the notion that we are charging for the value we provide in a way where it's in our interest that Zipwire helps you grow. That means, if you genuinely feel you have not derived that value from contact us for a [fair refund](../refund/index.md). We’ll treat you right.

## Zipwire-initiated cancellations

We may cancel and delete accounts if they have been inactive for an extended period:

* For frozen accounts: 6 months after being frozen due to billing failures
* For free accounts: after 6 months of inactivity

Note that we are obliged under data laws not to store data for longer than needed for the purposes for which it was collected.

We also retain the right to suspend or terminate accounts for any reason at any time, as outlined in our [Terms of Service](../terms/index.md). In practice, this generally means we will cancel your account without notice if we have evidence that you are using our products to engage in [abusive behavior](../abuse/index.md).
