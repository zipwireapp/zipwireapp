# Terms of Service

From everyone at Zipwire, thank you for using our products! We build them to help you do your best work. Because we don't know every one of our customers personally, we have to put in place some Terms of Service to help keep the ship afloat.

When we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document, we are referring to Evoq Limited, the company that currently owns and operates Zipwire. Evoq Limited is a company registered in England & Wales. Evoq Limited was founded over 20 years ago by Luke Puplett for his freelancing work decades before creating Zipwire. The Evoq name will be changed in due course.

When we say “Services”, we mean any product created and maintained by Evoq Limited. That includes Zipwire, whether delivered within a web browser, desktop application, mobile application, or another format.

When we say “You” or “your”, we are referring to the people or organizations that own an account with one or more of our Services. We have specific ownership policies for Zipwire.

We may update these Terms of Service in the future. You can track all changes made since they were forked from Basecamp's open policy documents, on GitHub. Initially these changes will be large and formative of the policies for Zipwire as they differ from Basecamp's originals. Once these initial sweeping changes are made and things have settled down, whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will also announce them on our company blog.

When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms of Service. That's true for any of our existing and future products and all features that we add to our Services over time. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not waiving that right or provision. These terms do contain a limitation of our liability.

If you violate any of the terms, we may terminate your account. That's a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us. We do our best to deserve that trust by being open about who we are, how we work, and keeping an open door to your feedback.

## Account Terms

1. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and any passwords, credentials or secrets that authenticate it. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation. We are working on two-factor authentication for added security but as of writing we are reliant on the security you have in place with any of our supported identity providers. In some of our Services, we may in future require it without prior notice.
1. You may not use the Services for any purpose outlined in our Use Restrictions policy.
1. You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account. That includes content posted by others who either: (a) have access to your login credentials; or (b) have their own logins under your account.
1. You must be a human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted.
1. You must provide accurate and complete information when registering your account, and you must promptly update this information if it changes.
1. You may not transfer your account to another person or entity.
1. You may not use the Services for any illegal activities.
1. You must not interfere with or disrupt the Services.
1. You must not use the Services to damage or impair the Company’s reputation or goodwill.
1. You must not attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services or its related systems or networks.
1. You must not use the Services to send spam or bulk unsolicited messages.
1. You may not resell, lease, or sublicense any of the Services.
1. You must not use the Services to violate any applicable law or regulation.

## Payment, Refunds, and Plan Changes

1. If you are using a free version or are within the free usage tier or consumption allowance of one of our Services, it is really free: we do not ask you for your credit card and — just like for customers who pay for our Services — we do not sell your data. However, we may in future use data that's necessary to operate planned services and features. We will explicitly seek permission to collect, use and share such data only in the ways you agree to, and any companies you work with agree to, and that are needed only to operate our future Services. We will obide by all regulations we are subject to and provide the means and capabilities for you to obide by regulations that you may be subject to.
1. For paid Services that offer a free trial, we explain the length of trial when you sign up. After the trial period, you need to pay in advance to keep using the Service. If you do not pay, we will freeze your account and it will be inaccessible until you make payment. If your account has been frozen for a while, we will queue it up for auto-cancellation. See our [Cancellation policy](../cancellation/index.md) for more details.
1. For Services that offer consumption based billing and have a free allowance, we explain the terms of the allowance within the product. Access to features beyond the allowance will be locked until you activate a paid subscription. Services consumption is measured and metered as you use the product within a billing cycle and you are subsequently billed for that usage. If you do not pay, we will freeze consumption of functionality past the stated allowance and may freeze your account completely until you make payment.
1. All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect those taxes on behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing authorities. See our [Taxes policy](../taxes/index.md) for more details. Otherwise, you are responsible for payment of all taxes, levies, or duties.
1. We process refunds according to our [Fair Refund policy](../refund/index.md).

## Account and Subscription Cancellation and Account Termination

1. Account cancellation is the act by you of permanently giving up access to your account and indicating that it can be disposed of and all its data erased. Cancellation and disposal and erasure may not occur simultaneously.
1. We erase all personally identifiable information rendering all your data inaccessible. After erasure, we will be unable to retrieve or attribute your data back to your account or you or any person.
1. Subscription cancellation is the act by you of stopping a paid subscription for our Services via our payment provider(s). Your account and all its data will continue to be accessible but paid features and metered functionality above the free allowance will be immediately unavailable. We measure consumption of functionality and bill you for it after it has been consumed. Any Services already consumed must be paid for in full and we reserve the right to freeze your account and make your data inaccessible until payment is made. We will cancel, dispose of and erase your data after 6 months.
1. Account suspension is the act by us of temporarily stopping your access to our Services.
1. Account termination is the act by us of permanently stopping your access to our Services and will be followed by permanent erasure of your data.
1. You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. Within each of our Services, we provide a link to manage your payment subscription with Stripe. You can find a cancel action within the Stripe portal. You can find instructions for how to cancel your account in our [Cancellation policy](../cancellation/index.md). An email or phone request to cancel your account is not automatically considered cancellation. If you need help cancelling your account, you can always contact our Support team.
1. If your account was recently created and has limited connections with other accounts, you can erase it and all its data via the action button under your account details. We are working to allow anyone to always be able to erase their account but at this time only accounts with a simple footprint can be erased by you. You can always contact support for an erasure and a technician will manually remove all your data.
1. All of your content will be inaccessible from the Services immediately upon account cancellation. Within 6 months, all content will be permanently erased from active systems and logs and backups. We cannot recover this information once it has been permanently erased.
1. If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up month, your cancellation will take effect immediately, and you will be charged only for Services consumed up the point of cancellation. See our [Fair Refund policy](../refund/index.md) for more details.
1. We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of our Services for any reason at any time. Suspension means you and any other users on your account will not be able to access the account or any content in the account. Termination will furthermore result in the erasure of your account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all content in your account. We also reserve the right to refuse the use of the Services to anyone for any reason at any time. We have this clause because statistically speaking, out of the hundreds of thousands of accounts on our Services, there is at least one doing something nefarious. There are some things we staunchly stand against and this clause is how we exercise that stance. For more details, see our [Use Restrictions policy](../abuse/index.md).
1. Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or retribution) of Company employee or officer will result in immediate account termination.
1. If we terminate or suspend your account for any reason, we will not be liable for any loss or damage incurred as a result.
1. We may terminate or suspend your account if it remains inactive, meaning there is no log in activity or usage of our Services, for a period of more than 6 months.

## Modifications to the Service and Prices

1. We commit to making every possible effort to ensure any content you submit to our Services remains accessible via the features and functionality we design. Sometimes, as functionality evolves, your content will evolve with it. For example, it may be presented in new ways that we hope are an improvement. Zipwire is software as a service which changes over time as we work to improve the product.
1. When it comes to security, privacy, and customer help, we will continue to support any legacy Services. Sometimes it becomes technically impossible to continue a feature or we redesign a part of our Services because we think it could be better or we decide to close new signups of a product. We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of our Services with or without notice.
1. If we retire a feature or make changes that impede access to content you have added, we will provide options to download that content or migrate it into a new subscription product or feature which provides continued access. We will give more than 6 weeks notice before making changes that permanently impede access to your data. Normally, your feature data will always be available as the feature changes, but in the unlikely event that we cannot provide continued access, we will not delete your data before 6 months notice has expired and repeated reminders and/or contact attempts from customer services have been ignored.
1. Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. We may or may not choose to change the prices for existing customers. If we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email address on record. We may also post a notice about changes on our websites or the affected Services themselves.
1. We will never enage in price gouging or behaviour which holds your content hostage or seeks to extort you. We commit to offering our Services at competitive prices and we are highly cognizant of the trust our customers place in us when they choose to subscribe and commit content into our products.

## Uptime, Security, and Privacy

1. Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these Services on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We do not offer service-level agreements for our Services but we take the uptime and reliability of our applications as seriously as we take our reputation. At the time of writing we use Google Cloud and design our systems to be resilient to outages. We store all data in ways that minimize the chance of loss from the most likely data-center catastrophes.
2. We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your usage significantly exceeds the average usage of other customers of the Services. Of course, we'll reach out to the account owner before taking any action except in rare cases where the level of use may negatively impact the performance of the Service for other customers.
3. We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups, redundancies, and encryption. Data is encrypted always; between end user devices and our servers, between our servers, and when at rest on disk. Please refer to our [Privacy Policy](https://zipwire.io/data/privacy) for full details and our [Security Response page](../security/response/index.md) for how to report a security incident or threat.
4. When you use our Services, you entrust us with your data. We take that trust to heart. You agree that Zipwire may process your data as described in our [Privacy Policy](https://zipwire.io/data/privacy) and for no other purpose. We as humans can access your data for the following reasons:
  - **To help you with support requests you make.** We'll ask for express consent before accessing your account.
  - **On the rare occasions when an error occurs that stops an automated process partway through.** We get automated alerts when such errors occur. When we can fix the issue and restart automated processing without looking at any personal data, we do. In rare cases, we have to look at a minimum amount of personal data to fix the issue. In these rare cases, we aim to fix the root cause as much as possible to avoid the errors from reoccurring.
  - **To safeguard Zipwire.** We'll look at logs and metadata as part of our work to ensure the security of your data and the Services as a whole. If necessary, we may also access accounts as part of an [abuse report investigation](../abuse/how-we-handle/index.md).
  - **To the extent required by applicable law.** As a UK company with all data infrastructure located in the US, we only preserve or share customer data if compelled by a UK government authority with a legally binding order. If a non-UK authority approaches Zipwire for assistance, our default stance is to refuse unless the order has been approved by the UK government, which compels us to comply through procedures outlined in an established mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement mechanism. If Zipwire is audited by a tax authority, we only share the bare minimum billing information needed to complete the audit.
5. We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Services as described in our [Privacy Policy](https://zipwire.io/data/privacy).

## Copyright and Content Ownership

1. All content posted on the Services must comply with UK copyright laws. We provide details on [how to file a copyright infringement claim](../copyright/index.md).
2. We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the Services. All materials uploaded remain yours.
3. We do not pre-screen content, but reserve the right (but not the obligation) in our sole discretion to refuse or remove any content that is available via the Service.
4. The names, look, and feel of the Services are copyright© to the Company. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of our code, including but not limited to the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements without express written permission from the Company. You must request permission to use the Company's logo or any Service logos for promotional purposes. Please email requests to use logos; we reserve the right to rescind this permission at any time and for any reason.
5. You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Services, use of the Services, or access to the Services without the express written permission by the Company.
6. You must not modify another website so as to falsely imply that it is associated with the Services or the Company.

## Features and Bugs

We design our Services with care, based on our own experience and the experiences of customers who share their time and feedback. However, there is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no guarantees that our Services will meet your specific requirements or expectations.

We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software, our Services inevitably have some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and we don't guarantee completely error-free Services.

## Services Adaptations and API Terms

We offer Application Program Interfaces ("API"s) for some of our Services (currently Zipwire, Highrise, Campfire, and Backpack). Any use of the API, including through a third-party product that accesses the Services, is bound by the terms of this agreement plus the following specific terms:

1. You expressly understand and agree that we are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.
2. Third parties may not access and employ the API if the functionality is part of an application that remotely records, monitors, or reports a Service user's activity *other than time tracking*, both inside and outside the applications. The Company, in its sole discretion, will determine if an integration service violates this bylaw. A third party that has built and deployed an integration for the purpose of remote user surveillance will be required to remove that integration.
3. Abuse or excessively frequent requests to the Services via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the API. The Company, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. If we need to suspend your account's access, we will attempt to warn the account owner first. If your API usage could or has caused downtime, we may cut off access without prior notice.

Some third-party providers have created integrations between our Services and theirs. You can find some of those integrations for Zipwire at https://zipwire.io/extras and for Highrise at https://highrisehq.com/extras/. We are not liable or accountable for any of these third-party integrations.

## Liability

We mention liability throughout these Terms but to put it all in one section:

***You expressly understand and agree that the Company shall not be liable, in law or in equity, to you or to any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if the Company has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from: (i) the use or the inability to use the Services; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or obtained or messages received or transactions entered into through or from the Services; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on the service; (v) or any other matter relating to this Terms of Service or the Services, whether as a breach of contract, tort (including negligence whether active or passive), or any other theory of liability.***

In other words: choosing to use our Services does mean you are making a bet on us. If the bet does not work out, that's on you, not us. We do our darnedest to be as safe a bet as possible through careful management of the business; investments in security, infrastructure, and talent; and in general [giving a damn](https://zipwire.io/about). If you choose to use our Services, thank you for betting on us.

If you have a question about any of the Terms of Service, please [contact our Support team]({{ site.email_support }}).
