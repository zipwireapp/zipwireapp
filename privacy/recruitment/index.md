# Recruitment Privacy Policy

## What we collect, where we store it, and how long we keep it

When you apply for a job at Zipwire (the company), we may store your data in several places.

1. Google Sheets
1. Trello
1. Our email servers

Candidate data we collect and process are used for selection purposes only and will be deleted after 6 months of our last contact with you. Access to your personal information is limited to Zipwire employees who participate in the selection process.

We collect and store these data because we have a legitimate interest: we are trying to hire for a position and we need information from any candidate who applies for the role. If you apply for a job at Zipwire, we ask for your explicit consent so that we can accept your application information, transfer it to the UK, and review your candidacy.

As a company operating in the UK, we are subject to a number of good data protection laws which give you rights over the data we hold about you, including the UK GDPR, the PECR and the DPA.

We store your data until we successfully fill the open position and then delete the data within 6 months. If we want to keep your information for longer than that — for instance, if we think we may want to contact you for a future open position — we'll request your explicit consent via email to continue to store your personal data with an updated time frame. You may ask us to access, correct, update, or delete your data at any time by emailing our data team, [data@zipwire.io](mailto:data@zipwire.io).

If you are in the EU, you can identify your specific authority to file a GDPR complaint at [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en).

## Changes & questions

We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices. You can view a history of the changes to our policies since spring-2023 [on GitHub](https://github.com/zipwireapp/zipwireapp/commit/master). Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will also announce them on our [company blog](https://zipwire.io/blog/).

Have any questions, comments, or concerns about this privacy policy, your data, or your rights with respect to your information? Please get in touch by emailing us at [data@zipwire.io](mailto:data@zipwire.io).
