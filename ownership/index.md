# Who owns a Zipwire account?

Zipwire accounts are owned by individuals, not by organizations. When you sign up and create a Zipwire account, you are the owner of that account and all the data in it. Our legal responsibility is to the account owner(s), so we won’t let other people take over your account without your permission.

## What does that mean with respect to a workplace?

A workplace has one or more administrators which are individual Zipwire user accounts. Some of the data within Zipwire has its owner set to the workplace and not an individual. If an individual account stops being a workplace administrator then they lose access to the workplace data. If a user is promoted to being a workplace administrator, then they will gain accesses to workplace data as expected, but they will never own that workplace data. An assignment is an example of workplace data.

Administrators can choose to delete data they have access to, including workplace data. For example, they may delete a workplace team. They can also delete their account, all its data and their workplace data. This functionality is available in the first several weeks of a workplace and administrator being setup and provides a means for people to try Zipwire out and then remove everything if they choose not to continue using the product.

## What if I am a senior to the person who setup my business on Zipwire?

Most of the time Zipwire is setup by someone who works for an organisation but does not control it. Normally, this isn't a problem as employees and people working at an organisation generally have the authority and trust to make choices, produce outputs and act in the best interests of their employer.

You should login to Zipwire and choose to act as a lone sender, i.e. not as an approver or processor since these options can lead you to setup another workplace, which is not what you want. Once you have a Zipwire account look at your account settings and note the email address. Then ask a person who is currently an administrator of the Zipwire workplace to add your email address as an administrator of the workplace. Log out and log back in again and you should have administrator access, too.

Administrators can remove other accounts from the workplace administrators team.

If you are able to get an existing administrator to add you, then [email support](mailto:support@zipwire.io) as we will need to verify your seniority at the workplace. We will need to see proof of control within the workplace, including a) an email from one of the verified domains for the workplace, preferably from the mailbox of an existing administrator in order to prove control b) the contact details of all significant owners of the business, including yourself c) proof of significant ownership from a third party.

We will perform checks using public records and contact other significant owners to verify your representation. If we suspect fraud or an unlawful attempt to gain control, we will immediately contact the relevant authorities.

We will attempt to contact all current administrators and simply ask them to add you. This is so that current administrators are aware of the change that will be made and because it is simply easier than a Zipwire engineer modifying data to forcibly add you. It also allows current administrators to raise objections and thwart attackers.

If after 7 working days the administrators are unresponsive despite repeated contact attempts, we will add your account as an administrator. If all current administrators object, then your request will be refused. Bear in mind that any current administrator can remove any other and forcibly adding your account can be immediately undone by a current administrator.

## What if I have another question about ownership?

Zipwire may update this policy once in a blue moon — we’ll notify you about significant changes by emailing the account owner or by placing a prominent notice on our site. You can access, change or delete your personal information at any time by [contacting Zipwire](mailto:support@zipwire.io).
